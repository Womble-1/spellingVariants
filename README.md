# spellingVariants
A word macro to find and replace words with an alternate spelling.   e.g. UK vs US spelling


Currently setup to look for a tab called "UKoed" in an excel document called "spellingvariants.xls" in My Documents. It will then look for each word in column A and if it finds a match it will replace it with the word on the same row in column B. 

US to UK word list provided as a csv. 

Very inefficient. could be optimised i'm sure.
